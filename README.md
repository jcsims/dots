# dots

My dotfiles in their most recent incarnation.

I wrote a [simple tool (golink)](https://github.com/jcsims/golink) designed to
work well with how these files are on named and laid out.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo somewhere handy (e.g. `~/.dotfiles`)
2. Install the `golink` tool: `go install github.com/jcsims/golink@latest`
3. Link your dotfiles into place: `golink`
